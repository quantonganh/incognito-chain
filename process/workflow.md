# Build Incognito with us

Incognito is open-source and accessible to everyone. Anyone can influence the direction of Incognito development - fix a bug or build a new feature.

## Communication Channels

[Github issues](https://github.com/incognitochain/incognito-chain/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/incognitochain/incognito-chain/pulls) are the primary communication channels.

You can also hang out on the Telegram https://t.me/incognitodev.  

## Development Workflow

Incognito uses a simple development workflow: all changes are done through [pull requests](https://github.com/incognitochain/incognito-chain/pulls) with no exception.

1. Fork your favorite [Incognito repository](https://github.com/incognitochain)
2. Create a branch
3. Commit your code
4. Create a pull request
5. Wait for your code to be reviewed and merged

## Pull Request Requirements

Here are the key requirements of a good pull request.

* Make it as easy as possible for reviewers.

* Each pull request should do only one thing and do it well: add a feature, fix a bug, or refactor code, but not a mixture of them.

* Avoid big pull requests because it's very difficult to review them.

* Document everything well - be clear and verbose.

* Must have unit tests and functional tests (if possible).

* Follow Incognito Coding Style.

* Do not break the existing test suite.
